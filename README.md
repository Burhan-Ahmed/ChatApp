## Points to Ponder
1. if else does not exit in jsx, thus use ternary operator because jsx is not a programming language but a syntax extension for xml

## NODE

1. use http along with built in createServer feature to create a server for http requests and responds.
2. Once the Server is created you can Either respond something or request something.(Mostly it is a res or response)
